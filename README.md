# COVID-19 90-Day All-Cause Readmission Prediction

## Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems globally. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to develop predictive models identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients and critical risk factors associated with COVID-19 90-day all-cause readmission. Leveraging the extensive Optum® de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record data set, our study aims to incorporate a diverse set of predictors to capture patients’ characteristics and assess individual risk profiles over an extended 90-day readmission period.
